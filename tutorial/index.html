    <title>Hello Babel Template</title>

<div>
    <p>You've just created a simple Babel Camel Route! This Route will simply log a greeting to any name it
        receives.</p>

    <h2>Small word about Camel</h2>

    <p>
        Babel Camel is a DSL to define Camel Routes. It adds type validation and improve the functionnal aspect of the
        existing Camel DSL.
        For those who are not use with Camel yet, Apache Camel is a mediation and a routing engine. It implements the
        "Enterprise Integration Patterns".
        Camel lets you define high level structure, the Routes, which handles the transformations, routing and mediation
        you want to do.
        In this example, we will only see three aspects of Camel:
    <ul>
        <li>read from something</li>
        <li>write to something</li>
        <li>modify</li>
    </ul>
    and we will read <b>from</b> something, we will write <b>to</b> something and we will modify by <b>process</b>ing.
    </p>
    <h2>Project structure</h2>

    <p>
        The Route is defined in the src/main/scala/*Route.scala file.
        The corresponding test is defined in the src/test/scala/*.RouteSpec.scala file.
    </p>

    <h2>Route code</h2>

    <p>
        The route code essentially takes the structure we defined higher: from -> process -> to
        The route actually starts with a from, defining the source of the Messages that would fly in the Route.
        The process (or processBody if affecting only the body of the Message) lets you define the transformation the message should take.
        The to, finally, defines where the message should be sent to.
    </p>
    <p>
        Both source and sink of messages are defined using Strings. Those strings actually define Camel Endpoints.
        Those string follow most of the time the following schema: "ENDPOINT_TYPE:ADDRESS[?PARAMETERS]" where PARAMETERS are optionals.

        You may also directly use existing Camel Endpoints if you prefer.
    </p>

    <h2>How to hack it</h2>

    <h3>Process</h3>

    <p>
        The easiest thing you may do is modifying the process function and then have a look to the logged result.
    </p>
    <p>
        You may add a second processBody keyword before the log keyword. While providing your function to this second
        processBody keyword, you may pay attention to the fact that type modification made in the first processBody
        keyword are actually taken into account in the second one.
    </p>
    <h2>What to do next</h2>

    <p>
        Incoming tutorial should come about the following subjects
    <ul>
        <li>split and aggregate</li>
        <li>message routing</li>
        <li>error handling</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
