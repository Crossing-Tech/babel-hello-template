    <p>You've just created a simple Babel Camel Route! This Route will simply log a greeting to any name it
        receives.</p>

    <h2>Small word about Camel</h2>

    <p>
        Babel Camel is a DSL to define Camel Routes. It adds type validation and improve the functional aspect of the
        existing Camel DSL.
        For those who are not use with Camel yet, Apache Camel is a mediation and a routing engine. It implements the
        "Enterprise Integration Patterns".
        Camel lets you define high level structure, the Routes, which handles the transformations, routing and mediation
        you want to do.
        In this example, we will only see three aspects of Camel:
    <ul>
        <li>read from something</li>
        <li>log it</li>
    </ul>
    and we will read <b>from</b> something and then <b>log</b> it. Then after we might also want to add some
    <b>process</b>ing.
    </p>

    <h2>Project structure</h2>

    <p>
        The Route is defined at <a href="#code/src/main/scala/HelloRoute.scala" class="shortcut">HelloRoute.scala</a>.
        The corresponding test is defined at<a href="#code/src/test/scala/HelloRouteSpec.scala" class="shortcut">HelloRouteSpec.scala</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Route code</h2>

    <p>
        The route code essentially takes the structure we defined higher: <code>from</code> -> <code>log</code>
        The route actually starts with a <code>from</code>, defining the source of the Messages that would fly in the
        Route.
        Right after the <code>from</code> keyword, a <code>log</code> keyword let you define what you want to log.
    </p>

    <p>
        Both source (<code>from</code>) and sink(<code>to</code>) of messages are defined using Strings. Those strings
        actually define Camel Endpoints.
        Those string follow most of the time the following schema: "ENDPOINT_TYPE:ADDRESS[?PARAMETERS]" where PARAMETERS
        are optionals.

        You may also directly use existing Camel Endpoints if you prefer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Logging(<code>log</code>) is defined also using a string.
        Those string follow most of the time the following schema: "ENDPOINT_TYPE:ADDRESS[?PARAMETERS]" where PARAMETERS
        are optionals.

        You may also directly use existing Camel Endpoints if you prefer.
    </p>

    <h2>How to hack it</h2>

    <h3>Process</h3>

    <p>
        The easiest thing you may do is to get control of what is being done.
        To do so, open <a href="#code/src/main/scala/HelloRoute.scala" class="shortcut">HelloRoute.scala</a>.
        Add a <code>processBody</code> keyword in the middle of your route (between the
        <code>from("direct:hello")</code> and the <code>log("Hello ${body}")</code>). A nice little thing would be to
        remove do the String concatenation with your <code>processBody</code> and no more with the <code>log</code>.

        The <code>processBody</code> accepts a function such as I => O where I is the type of the input body and O is
        the type of the output body. Create a function <pre><code>def hello (input: Any): String = s"Hello $input"</code></pre>.

        Then your log keyword might look like <code>to("log:hello")</code> as the concatenation is done in the
        <code>processBody</code> keyword. You may also write the concatenated string to a file with<code>to("file:file-path")</code>.

        Your processBody may also take an anonymous function. It may look like <code>processBody(x => "Hello " + x)</code>
        or <pre><code>processBody("Hello " + _)</code></pre>.
    .

        By the way, we unfortunately have not been able to provide a functional API for the <code>log</code> keyword.
        This is thus a nice thing to avoid using the <code>"${body}"</code> tooling as this is managed by the Camel
        Expression language.
    </p>

    <p>
        Maybe you do not like the String and its ability to concatenate with anything so let's ensure we have a String
        as input of our <code>processBody</code> keyword. To do so, right after the <code>from</code> statement, add a new
        keyword: <code>requireAs</code> and the wanted Type. This will enforce the route to ensure its content is, at this
        point, a String. You may get something like that:
        <pre><code>from("direct:hello").requireAs[String].processBody(x => s"Hello $x").to("log:hello")</code></pre>
        Your IDE should be informed that the <code>x</code> is of type String.

    </p>
    <p>
        Good! At this point, you already have feel the two main aspects that Babel adds: Types and Functions. Let's take
        a slightly more complicate and useful example: let's shake a bit the putting all the vowels to the beginning using
        <code>HelloRoute.vowelAndConsonant</code>. You may use a first <code>processBody</code> to split the input into
        two arrays of char and the another <code>processBody</code> to create the result String.

        Finally, you may get something like
        <pre><code>
        from("direct:hello").requireAs[String]
        .processBody(HelloRoute.vowelAndConsonant)
        .processBody(x => (x._1.toList ::: x._2.toList).mkString(""))
        .to("log:hello")
        </code></pre>

        The good thing is that the second <code>processBody</code> really typechecks its function. Now, you have a good
        overview of what Babel is good for. We will see in the incoming ones other keywords.
